# TED talks - NLP tutorial

In this project, you will get a look to how to extract patterns in text data. The dataset used is TED talks transcripts, where the problem will be "what are the most important words?" and "what are the main subjects/topics that those TEDs are talking about?". In NLP context, these questions take part of *feature extraction* and *topic modeling* problems. I hope it helps you to comprehend the power of these techniques to provide rich information from text data.
